Neuroinformatics is an emerging field of research that comprises the use of
modern data-intensive technologies in neuroscience. Its practice requires both
broad knowledge of neuroscience as well as substantive competency in data
science. The neuroinformatics working group at the University of Washington (UW)
[eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) and the University of
Washington [Institute for Neuroengineering (UWIN)](http://uwin.washington.edu/)
focuses on neuroinformatics methods and their role in understanding the brain.

During the Winter quarter 2018, we will meet every other week on Monday (starting January 8th) at 11 AM in [Kincaid](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/kin) room 356 (the UWIN conference room).  

To join the group, and receive information about the meetings, please sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailman12.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/neuroinformatics).
