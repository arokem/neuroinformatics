Neuroinformatics is an emerging field of research that comprises the use of
modern data-intensive technologies in neuroscience. Its practice requires both
broad knowledge of neuroscience as well as substantive competency in data
science. The neuroinformatics working group at the University of Washington (UW)
[eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) and the University of
Washington [Institute for Neuroengineering (UWIN)](http://uwin.washington.edu/)
focuses on neuroinformatics methods and their role in understanding the brain.

During the Fall quarter 2017, we will meet every other week on Thursday (starting October 5th) at 3 PM in [Kincaid](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/kin) room 356 (the UWIN conference room).
